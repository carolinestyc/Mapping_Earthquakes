# Mapping_Earthquakes
  Challenge 13

## Project Overview
Working with Basil and Sadhana, I have plotted earthquake data across a MapBox map. The map created has 3 different base layers so the user can toggle between the map they prefer. There is also functionality to turn off data layers; a layer for all earth quakes, earthquakes with a maginude greater than 4.5 and the tectonic plates. This map easily allows the user to see the occurence of the last 7 days of earthquakes relative to the location of the tectonic plates. 

### Resources
            Data Sources: Earthquakes over 4.5: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson
            All Earthquakes the last 7 days: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
            
            Software: VS Code, MapBox, Leaflet, JavaScript, GEOJson, html, css
When the user opens the website it looks like the below:
